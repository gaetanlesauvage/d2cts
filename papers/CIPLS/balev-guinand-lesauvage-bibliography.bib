This paper presents ant colony algorithm for solving the multi-objective Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSP). The objectives considered in this study include the minimization of makespan, mean flow time, and mean  tardiness. The proposed algorithm is  tested on many benchmark problems up to  15 jobs × 10 machine. The results obtained
have shown that the proposed algorithm is a feasible and effective approach for the multiple-objective problem.}},

abstract = {Organization is a central concept in systems. In this paper an
	ant algorithm for detecting organizations is presented. In a discrete-time
	context, at each time-step, an organization corresponds to a set of closely
	interacting entities in a system. This system is mapped to a graph where
	nodes represent entities and edges represent interrelations. Several
	colonies of ants compete, and inside each colony, ants collaborate in order
	to colonize the graph. Detected organizations emerge from the global
	behavior of the ants. The proposed approach is compared to other methods on
	a graph where the organizations are already known. It is then tested on two

Experimental evidence demonstrates that species differ in the accuracy of their recruitment. We show here, with the help of a very simple mathematical model, that the randomness of of behaviour can have an adaptative advantage for ants. The model demonstrates that the degree of randomness could be optimally "tuned" to particular ecological conditions, such as food quantity and distribution.},
annote={Long lasting structures lack the plasticity needed in a fluctuating environment and high rates of development of rigid structures cost energy. In this situation,
 one possible reaction of the society is to try to eliminate externam fluctuations. One way is to damp the external fluctuations with homeostatic mechanisms: the colony tries to minimize the external fluctuations by appropriate behaviours (stock management,
 temperature control,
...). Another possible reaction to fluctuating environment is the development of temporary structure (e.g. recruitment trail) geberated by a self-organization process. With the help of a mathematical model,
 we suggest that a certain amount of noise during recruitment could play an adaptative role for the society. Clearly more noise is advantageous when the food is parcelled,
 and when each source is less rewarding.},

The approach is simulative in that the operation of the shop is simulated in a Fortran program, but in addition to the straightforward use of priority rules for determining sequences of jobs on the machines, a number of heuristics or rules of thumb are incorporated. Both the static and dynamic problems are investigated. The efficacy of a small number of heuristics in combination with certain priority rules is demonstrated.},

    abstract = {{A great deal of research has been focused on solving the job-shop problem (P J), over the last forty years, resulting in a wide variety of approaches. Recently, much effort has been concentrated on hybrid methods to solve P J as a single technique cannot solve this stubborn problem. As a result much effort has recently been concentrated on techniques that combine myopic problem specific methods and a meta-strategy which guides the search out of local optima. These approaches currently provide the best results. Such hybrid techniques are known as iterated local search algorithms or meta-heuristics. In this paper we seek to assess the work done in the job-shop domain by providing a review of many of the techniques used. The impact of the major contributions is indicated by applying these techniques to a set of standard benchmark problems. It is established that methods such as Tabu Search, Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing should be considered complementary rather than competitive. In addition this work suggests guide-lines on features that should be incorporated to create a good P J system. Finally the possible direction for future work is highlighted so that current barriers within P J maybe surmounted as we approach the 21st Century.}},

    abstract = {{The CALAS project consists in a laser measure system allowing to localize precisely straddle carriers in a container terminal. The information given by such a tool makes an optimization possible. In fact, a box terminal is an open system subject to dynamics, in which many events can occur. Among others, they concern container arrivals and departures. Within the terminal, straddle carriers are trucks which are able to carry one container at a time in order to move it through the terminal. We aim to optimize the straddle carrier handling in order to improve the terminal management. Moreover, missions come into the system in an unpredictable way and straddle carriers are handled by humans. They can choose to follow the schedule or not. For these reasons, the exact state of the system is unknown. The optimization process that we try to build must be fail-safe and adaptive. In this context, we propose an approach using a meta-heuristic based on Ant Colony to resolve the problem of assigning missions to straddle carriers. We built a simulator which is able to test and to compare different scheduling policies.}},

abstract = "Scheduling can be divided into two classes, viz. predictive and reactive scheduling. Predictive scheduling addresses problems with deterministic process times and machine availability and generates a solution valid for the entire time span specified. Reactive scheduling, on the other hand, deals with the problem of maintaining schedules in a dynamic environment such as processing delays, machine breakdown, etc. In this paper a review of the research on scheduling in a dynamic environment is presented. Scheduling approaches have been classified into three categories, viz. conventional, knowledge-based and distributed problem solving."
