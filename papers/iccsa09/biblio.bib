The growth of containerization, transporting goods in a container, has created many problems for ports, i.e. higher requirements on terminals and infrastructure. many container terminals are reaching their capacity limits and increasingly leading to traffic and port congestion. the focus of the research involves the performance from the container terminal manager´s perspective and how to improve the understanding of the factors of productivity and how they are related to each other.}
