    abstract = {{The CALAS project consists in a laser measure system allowing to localize precisely straddle carriers in a container terminal. The information given by such a tool makes an optimization possible. In fact, a box terminal is an open system subject to dynamics, in which many events can occur. Among others, they concern container arrivals and departures. Within the terminal, straddle carriers are trucks which are able to carry one container at a time in order to move it through the terminal. We aim to optimize the straddle carrier handling in order to improve the terminal management. Moreover, missions come into the system in an unpredictable way and straddle carriers are handled by humans. They can choose to follow the schedule or not. For these reasons, the exact state of the system is unknown. The optimization process that we try to build must be fail-safe and adaptive. In this context, we propose an approach using a meta-heuristic based on Ant Colony to resolve the problem of assigning 
missions to straddle carriers. We built a simulator which is able to test and to compare different scheduling policies.}},

    abstract = {{<p>In real-world problems related to finance, business, and management, mathematicians and economists frequently encounter optimization problems. In this classic book, George Dantzig looks at a wealth of examples and develops linear programming methods for their solutions. He begins by introducing the basic theory of linear inequalities and describes the powerful simplex method used to solve them. Treatments of the price concept, the transportation problem, and matrix methods are also given, and key mathematical concepts such as the properties of convex sets and linear vector spaces are covered. </p><p>George Dantzig is properly acclaimed as the "father of linear programming." Linear programming is a mathematical technique used to optimize a situation. It can be used to minimize traffic congestion or to maximize the scheduling of airline flights. He formulated its basic theoretical model and discovered its underlying computational algorithm, the "simplex method," in a pathbreaking memorandum 
published by the United States Air Force in early 1948. <i>Linear Programming and Extensions</i> provides an extraordinary account of the subsequent development of his subject, including research in mathematical theory, computation, economic analysis, and applications to industrial problems.</p><p> Dantzig first achieved success as a statistics graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley. One day he arrived for a class after it had begun, and assumed the two problems on the board were assigned for homework. When he handed in the solutions, he apologized to his professor, Jerzy Neyman, for their being late but explained that he had found the problems harder than usual. About six weeks later, Neyman excitedly told Dantzig, "I've just written an introduction to one of your papers. Read it so I can send it out right away for publication." Dantzig had no idea what he was talking about. He later learned that the "homework" problems had in fact been two famous unsolved problems in statistics.</p>}},

It is only after experimental work has shown the practical interest of the method that researchers try to deepen their understanding of the method's functioning not only through more and more sophisticated experiments but also by means of an effort to build a theory. Tackling questions such as  ” how and why the method works'' is important, because finding an answer may help in improving its applicability. Ant colony optimization, which was introduced in the early 1990s as a novel technique for solving hard combinatorial optimization problems, finds itself currently at this point of its life cycle. With this article we provide a survey on theoretical results on ant colony optimization. First, we review some convergence results. Then we discuss relations between ant colony optimization algorithms and other approximate methods for optimization. Finally, we focus on some research 
efforts directed at gaining a deeper understanding of the behavior of ant colony optimization algorithms. Throughout the paper we identify some open questions with a certain interest of being solved in the near future.}},

The main characteristic of these algorithms is the relaxation of most of the constraints of the problem during its solution. The same approach can be used for the solution of the m-salesmen problem in which m salesmen starting from the same city must visit only once n cities at minimum cost. The number of salesmen can be fixed in advance or allowed to vary, upper and lower bounds set on the number of salesmen and even fixed costs associated with the salesmen. The results obtained so far are very encouraging. Problems of up to 100 cities have been solved optimally for the m-travelling salesmen case and other more complex problems are currently under study.}},

The subproblems that arise are all assignment problems and can thus be solved efficiently. The various side constraints are taken into acount in the branching process, by fixing some of the variables at zero or one, thereby preserving the assignment structure.

	for nets containing circles; and that for any logical expression
	satisfying certain conditions, one can find a net behaving in the
	fashion it describes. It is shown that many particular choices among
	possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense
	that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another
	net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although
	perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus

These side conditions pertain to load, distance and time, or sequencing restrictions. The heuristic is an extension of the highly successful one of Lin and Kernighan for the single traveling salesman problem. Computational experience with widely tested vehicle dispatch problems indicates that the proposed heuristic consistently yields better solutions than existing heuristics that have appeared in the literature. Run times grow approximately as N<sup>2.3</sup>, where N is the number of cities. The heuristic is generally slower than the modified SWEEP heuristic except on problems having a large number of points per route.}},
